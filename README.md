# CSE FINAL Project
## Group B6: Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis of Heart Disease Data

By: Beth Gronski & Jane Chea

## Instructions
### Data
You will find our data here in this repository under the name heart_disease_uci.csv.
It is in the file for convienence and should run with the code.

### Libraries
For our analysis you will need to install the pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot,
statsmodels, and sklearn libraries. Once installed, those libraries should load
as you run each of our files. You can see the libraries at the top of each
Jupyter notebook file.

### Analysis in Jupyter Notebooks
Within Jupyter notebooks you should see our code, and the output we got when we ran it.
You should be able to rerun the code yourself. Fair warning: when you rerun our machine
learning code you will change the training and testing data which will change our results.
However important output like our confusion matricies and scores should only fluctuate
slightly

## Analysis in Python files
When you run our files, output should automatically be generated similar to our Juypter
notebook files. There are print statements included for easier readability. For in-depth
analysis please reference our Jupyter notebooks. We left the analysis in these files because
it is much easier to read and is paired with the output. The functions in our .py files
are the same as the ones in the notebooks.
