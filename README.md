# Project Proposal

By: Beth Gronski & Jane Chea

## Summary of research questions
Give a numbered list of 3 or more research questions and a brief description of what you will investigate. Each research question should have 1–3 sentences and propose something that can be definitively answered, not just a general topic or area of investigation.

## Motivation
Expand on your research questions by providing context about why you care about the problem. How does knowing the answers affect the world or our understanding of it?

## Dataset
Describe the real, existing dataset that you will use, including exact URLs. You may not use a dataset that has been used in a previous CSE 163 assignment or demo. You may not repeat an analysis that you have performed in another class (though you might do something inspired by another class). The data must be real — neither you nor someone else may make up the data.

## Challenge goals
Select at least 2 challenge goals that you are planning to meet. Justify why you think your project will meet each goal. Try to bold the name of your challenge goal to make it obvious which one you are talking about. If you would like to meet more than 2 goals, discuss the 2 goals that you’re most passionate about.

## Method
For each research question, outline the steps you will takes to implement your project deliverables. You should provide enough detail that someone else could independently reproduce your experiment. For each computation, indicate how the result would lead you to a conclusion about one or more research questions. Highlight connections to challenge goals. Refer to specific rows, columns, or elements in your dataset. You will not need to provide any code, but your methodology should contain enough details that a TA will be able to understand how you will approach the computation.

## Work Plan
Describe your plan to divide the project into at least 3 (but no more than 7) discrete tasks, each with an estimate of the time in hours required for each task. Then, describe your workflow for developing code, testing code, and coordinating work—particularly how team members can support each other in case one task is unexpectedly challenging. You should also discuss with your group the specifics of how you will develop Python and show that you’ve set up your development environment (see here for more information on development environments. All team members must contribute equally to the deliverables.
- While you don’t need to submit any proof you’ve done so, you should do the local development setup for Python on your computer if possible. A very common challenge students face on the project is realizing too late that they can’t use an online solution since their dataset is too large or it might not have the library you want. You must install Python on your computer early to help you avoid running into this later.
